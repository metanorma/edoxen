== Purpose

Edoxen is a set of information models used for representing resolution and
decision information. They are designed to provide a structured way to model
formal resolutions, including their metadata, actions, considerations, and
approvals.

The `edoxen` gem provides a Ruby library for working with these models,
allowing users to create, manipulate, and serialize resolution data in a
structured format. It is built on top of the `lutaml-model` serialization
framework, which provides a flexible and extensible way to define data models
and serialize them to YAML or JSON formats.

This library is particularly useful for standards organizations, committees,
and governance bodies that need to maintain structured records of their
decision-making processes.


== Origin

"Edoxen" is how all resolutions of Ancient Athens started.

____
"It was the opinion of... (the people and city that...)"
____

The word "edoxen" originates from the Ancient Greek word edokeō (ἔδοξεν),
meaning "it was the opinion of" or "it seemed good to". This term was used in
the context of formal resolutions and decisions made by the Athenian assembly,
reflecting the collective will and judgment of the citizens.


== Features

* Classes for modeling resolutions, actions, considerations, and approvals
* Support for resolution collections with metadata
* YAML and JSON serialization with round-trip compatibility
* Structured identifiers and meeting information
* Resolution relationships and dependencies
* Integration with the `lutaml-model` serialization framework
* Comprehensive YAML schema for validation
* Real-world data compatibility with ISO/TC 154 resolution formats

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'edoxen'
----

And then execute:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install edoxen
----

== Quick start

Here's a minimal example to get you started:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'edoxen'

# Create a simple resolution
resolution = Edoxen::Resolution.new(
  title: "Adoption of new standard",
  type: "resolution",
  category: "Technical resolutions",
  identifier: "2024-01"
)

# Add an action to the resolution
action = Edoxen::Action.new(
  type: "resolves",
  message: "to adopt ISO 12345 as a new standard",
  date_effective: Date.new(2024, 1, 15)
)
resolution.actions = [action]

# Add a consideration
consideration = Edoxen::Consideration.new(
  type: "having",
  message: "reviewed the technical specifications"
)
resolution.considerations = [consideration]

# Serialize to YAML
puts resolution.to_yaml

# Create a resolution collection
collection = Edoxen::ResolutionCollection.new(
  metadata: {
    title: "Resolutions of the 42nd plenary meeting",
    date: "2024-01-15",
    source: "ISO/TC 154 Secretariat"
  },
  resolutions: [resolution]
)

# Serialize collection to YAML
puts collection.to_yaml
----

== Documentation

=== Data models

The library provides these main model classes:

`Edoxen::Resolution`::
Core model representing a formal resolution with title, type, category, and
associated elements.

`Edoxen::ResolutionCollection`::
Container for multiple resolutions with metadata about the meeting or
collection context.

`Edoxen::Action`::
Represents actions taken within a resolution (e.g., "resolves", "requests",
"thanks").

`Edoxen::Consideration`::
Models considerations that lead to a resolution (e.g., "having", "noting",
"recognizing").

`Edoxen::Approval`::
Captures approval information including type and degree of consensus.

`Edoxen::MeetingIdentifier`::
Contains meeting identification information such as venue, date, and identifier.

`Edoxen::ResolutionRelationship`::
Defines relationships between resolutions (e.g., "supersedes", "amends").

=== Architecture overview

The library is built on `lutaml-model` and follows these design principles:

**Model-based approach**::
Each entity is represented as a Ruby class with defined attributes and
serialization mappings.

**Flexible serialization**::
Support for both YAML and JSON formats with automatic type conversion and
round-trip compatibility.

**Extensible structure**::
Models allow additional properties beyond the core schema, enabling
customization for specific organizational needs.

**Real-world compatibility**::
Designed to work with existing resolution data formats used by standards
organizations.

== Usage workflow

The `edoxen` workflow follows a straightforward approach:

=== 1. Data modeling

. **Create resolutions**: Instantiate `Resolution` objects with required
  attributes
. **Add components**: Attach actions, considerations, approvals as needed
. **Build collections**: Group resolutions into collections with metadata

=== 2. Serialization and persistence

. **Export to YAML/JSON**: Use built-in serialization methods
. **Validate structure**: Leverage the provided YAML schema for validation
. **Round-trip processing**: Load and save data while preserving structure

== YAML format specification

Edoxen uses a structured YAML format for resolution data. Here's an example:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  title: "Resolutions of the 42nd plenary meeting of ISO/TC 154"
  date: "2024-01-15"
  source: "ISO/TC 154 Secretariat"
  venue: "Virtual meeting"

resolutions:
  - identifier: "2024-01"
    title: "Adoption of new standard"
    type: "resolution"
    category: "Technical resolutions"

    considerations:
      - type: "having"
        message: "reviewed the technical specifications"

    actions:
      - type: "resolves"
        message: "to adopt ISO 12345 as a new standard"
        date_effective: "2024-01-15"

    approvals:
      - type: "affirmative"
        degree: "unanimous"
----

=== Schema validation

A comprehensive YAML schema is provided at `schema/edoxen.yaml` for validating
resolution data files. The schema follows JSON Schema Draft 7 conventions and
includes:

* Complete structure definitions for all model types
* Enumerated values for type validation
* Date format validation
* Flexible extensibility with `additionalProperties`

The schema can be used with standard JSON Schema validators to ensure data
integrity and compliance.

== Real-world examples

The library has been tested with real resolution data from ISO/TC 154 and
other standards organizations. It successfully handles:

* Complex resolution structures with multiple actions and considerations
* Various resolution types (resolutions, recommendations, decisions)
* Meeting metadata and organizational information
* Cross-references and relationships between resolutions
* Historical data migration and format conversion
