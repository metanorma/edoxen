  # Distinct from Agenda (the business order drafted before the
  # meeting) and from ResolutionCollection (the formal decisions
  # adopted). The Minutes are the running record.
  #
  # Sections are typically keyed by agenda-item number so consumers
  # can join Minutes ↔ AgendaItem ↔ Resolution by `number`/`label`.
